                    Creating an online presence is similar to creating a physical presence. You want your appearance to
                    reflect your beliefs, profession, and ideas, as well as attract others to you. We believe the same
                    should be applied to your online presence; consisting of a web site, social media, blogging, etc.
                    You
                    want your image on the web to be unique, not some template that has been used for hundreds of other
                    websites, and we know just how to make that happen. Take a look at our
                    <a href="portfolio.php">portfolio</a> and see what we have done for others.

                <p>Want to be seen? How about heard? Sometimes this can feel like a very daunting task, especially on
                    the internet. You have a great product or service on your website, yet the only people that know
                    about it are the ones you have told. How is this any better than word of mouth? Fortunately, we know
                    exactly how to take your online presence and expand it to help bring the traffic you want to your
                    website. We do this by:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Submit proper sitemaps and robot files to major search engines for indexing</li>
                    <li>Analyzing your information to generate a relevant list of keywords for your site or product</li>
                    <li>Create a "buzz" on the internet by targeting relevant websites, blogs, and forums and
                        distributing your product/service information with link backs to your site
                    </li>
                    <li>Analyze site traffic data in order to provide the best results to our clients</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Every month we provide our clients with detailed reports and statistics for their website and the
                    work done for that month by our SEO analyst. Expanding your presence online takes time, unless you
                    are google, which is why we offer this service on a month to month basis, starting with an initial 2
                    month retainer.</p>

                <p>CMSâ€¦.besides being another acronym we use to confuse people, it stands for content management system,
                    and is a
                    great system to have in place for a website owner. A CMS, such as Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, or a
                    custom CMS,
                    gives us a way to design a fantastic website for our clients, hide all the coding and nonsense, and
                    replace it
                    with an interface our clients can use to manage their own content if they want to. Some of the great
                    things we
                    can do for your website that can be client-managed with a CMS are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blogging capabilities</li>
                    <li>Dynamic websites; add as many pages as you like</li>
                    <li>Site membership</li>
                    <li>Forums</li>
                    <li>Memberships and Subscriptions</li>
                    <li>Media Galleries</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you are a hands on kind of person and want to be more involved with your website, then adding a
                    content
                    management system to your site would be a good option for you. We will gladly help train our clients
                    and answer
                    any questions they have when using a CMS, and offer low cost maintenance packages for our clients
                    that do use a
                    CMS. If you would like to integrate a CMS to your existing site, or have a new site created with a
                    CMS, then
